    <div class="mission">
 	<p>
 		The Charleston DSA is facilitating the transition to a truly democratic and socialist society,
 		one in which the means/resources of production are democratically and socially handled and distributed.
 	</p>
 		<br>
 	<p>
		The Charleston DSA, in conjunction with national DSA and other local DSA Chapters, rejects an economic order based 
		on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, brutality and violence in 
		defense of the status quo, or discrimination of any type, including that based on race, color, national 
		origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, ability, or family status. 
		It envisions a humane social order based on popular sustainment of resources and production, 
		economic planning, equitable distribution, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.
	</p>
		<br>
 	<p>
		The Charleston DSA’s socialism is a profoundly democratic one. It is rooted in the belief that human beings should be 
		free to develop to their fullest potential, that public policies should be determined not by wealth but by 
		popular participation, and that self-determination should be carefully safeguarded. It is committed to a 
		freedom of speech that does not recoil from dissent and to the freedom to organize independent trade unions,
		women’s groups, political parties, and other formations -- recognizing these as essential bulwarks against 
		the dangers of an intrusive state. It is committed to a freedom of religion that upholds the rights of those
		for whom spiritual concerns are central.
	</p>
		<br>
 	<p>
		As socialists, we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving this vision. We are creating a visible 
		socialist presence within the broad democratic left. In the long run, we will build a majority movement 
		making democratic socialism a reality in the United States because our strategy actively resists a class 
		structure wherein those with enormous economic power reign over the vast majority of the remaining 
		population.
